2. Added javascript to open and close hamburger menu in mobiles
3. Fixed navbar to top
4. Change logo
5. Update menu items

# Doubts
1. Now that navbar is fixed to top, how does it play with content? do i need to give space using <html class="has-navbar-fixed-top"> as mentioned in above doc? even in react?
